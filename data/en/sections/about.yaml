# a summary about you
summary: 'I am a passionate software engineer with 3+ years of working experience. I build tools for PaaS Cloud Computing using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), Java, and Python. They enable people to develop, run, and manage business applications without the need to build and maintain the underlying infrastructure. Outside of work, I indulge in recreational software-development, like writing an automated responder for Facebook comments.'
